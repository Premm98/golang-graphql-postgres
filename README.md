# golang-graphql-postgres
created a database in postgres, used graphql as in intermediate layer and golang was used as backend language. No front end has been designed. To check for data retrieval, i used graphiQL.

## You have to create a database locally in your system to make the code work
### Remember to change the password and username as you used to create your database and user.
